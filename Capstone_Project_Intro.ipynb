    "Today we are going to discover the best locations in Toronto to open up a new coffee shop. When finding a good location, it's important to keep in mind where your competition is and what areas your target market will be attracted to. So what we're going to do is discover where the locations of venues that would host people who would want to drink coffee more often than others and find out what neighborhoods host the highest balance of these locations to coffee shops that already exist around those parts. Some of these locations will include schools, colleges, libraries, office buildings, and malls. "

    "For this project, we'll simply be using Foursquare to figure out which areas have the highest concentration of desired locations and which areas have the highest concentration of competitors. We'll be able to use location data to find how many desired venues and competitors there are within a certain radius of a given neighborhood. This way, we'll be able to see what locations are within a walking distance to each neighborhood, and therefore be able to tell what locations are theoretically best for the location of our new coffee shop.
